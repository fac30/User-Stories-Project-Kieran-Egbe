 ## Our goals were:
 ### Create a website with the following features:

 - 
 - Navbar with clickable navigation
 - About us section
 - Contact form which submits with a clickable button and mandatory fields
 - Is accessible to visually impaired users with
    - keyboard navigation
    - navigation with a screen reader

 ### Stretch goal:
 As a stretch goal we created and utilised the github Projects template.  We used the auto update feature to move issues to Completed when the issues are closed.

## Features of our site deployment:

### Responsive Design: 
The website is designed to be fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes for optimal viewing on mobiles, tablets, and desktops.

### Dynamic Navigation Bar: 
A navigation bar with links to different sections of the website such as Home, About Us, Meet the Team, and Contact Us.  The nav links are replaced with a hmaburger icon for mobile devices.

### Interactive Quote Popup: 
A feature for users to request a customized quote. Includes a form to capture user details like email.  The button to submit the form does not have any true storage/send functionality.
